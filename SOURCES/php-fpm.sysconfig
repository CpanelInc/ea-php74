# Additional environment file for php-fpm

# This file is deprecated when systemd is used and
# will be removed in the future

# With systemd >= 204 you can simply drop a file with the
# suffix .conf in /etc/systemd/system/php-fpm.service.d, with
#     [Service]
#     Environment=FOO=bar

# See systemd documentation.
#    man systemd.unit
#    man systemd.exec
